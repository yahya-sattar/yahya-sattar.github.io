I am a Postdoctoral Associate affiliated with the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, working with <a href='https://sdean.website'>Prof. Sarah Dean</a>. I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2023 under the supervision of <a href='https://sota.engin.umich.edu'>Prof. Samet Oymak</a> at University of California Riverside, where my research focused on <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yahya-Sattar-3/publication/376076888_thesis/links/6568cf00ce88b870312083ab/thesis.pdf'>statistical learning and adaptive control of complex dynamical systems</a>. 

My research interests revolve broadly around the statistical and algorithmic aspects of <strong>sequential learning</strong> and <strong>decision making</strong> in dynamic settings, with applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and broader scientific and engineering domains. More precisely, I study the learning and inference problems arising in <strong><font color="CornflowerBlue">Optimal Control</font></strong>, <strong><font color="CornflowerBlue">Reinforcement Learning</font></strong>, and <strong><font color="CornflowerBlue">Machine Learning</font></strong>, using tools and concepts from <strong>Statistical Learning</strong>, <strong>Optimization</strong>, and <strong>Control Theory</strong>.
